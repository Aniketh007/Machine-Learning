# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository
Welcome to my Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This project serves as a comprehensive record of my learning journey in machine learning, focusing on understanding and implementing key algorithms alongside their mathematical derivations.

**Purpose**<br>
The aim of this repository is to solidify my knowledge of machine learning algorithms by implementing each from scratch as I learn. My goal is to eventually include all fundamental and advanced algorithms, along with clear explanations of the underlying mathematics, enabling anyone interested to follow along.

**Current Progress**<br>
As I work through each topic, Iâ€™ll update the ReadMe to include:

* A list of algorithms completed
* An overview of concepts covered
* Key takeaways from the mathematical derivations and algorithmic insights

**How to Use This Repository**<br>
This repository is designed for learners and enthusiasts who are interested in exploring machine learning algorithms in depth. Each algorithm folder will contain:

* Code Implementation: A Python-based implementation of the algorithm
* Mathematical Derivation: Step-by-step derivations to build intuition
* Documentation: Markdown notes detailing my thought process, approach, and key insights

**Getting Started**<br>
To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniketh007/Machine-Learning.git
```

**Future Plans**<br>
I aim to include more algorithms and concepts as I learn them, gradually expanding the scope and depth of the repository. I will also continue refining the explanations and optimizing the code as I grow in this field.
